        I didn't make this game, but before this was alive to be able to play as a game, I was assigned to make this game's prototype idea's video.
        <br>
        <br>
        Th game's trailer below is the same prototype I had made for the client was the most successful prototype and got trended at that time.
        <br>
        <br>
        There wasn't any challenging part for me during the prototype process, 
        but the most time consumming parts were making animations, such as drivers' waving hands and targeting gas nozzle to car's filler cap area as the client's script, in Unity.
