        I was assigned to replace Unity Ads SDK and upgrade another Ads SDK, called LionSDK by Applovin, in this game
        <a href= "https://route-magicant-inc.en.aptoide.com/app" target="_blank">Route</a>.
        The developer working on this SDK provided manual SDK documents, but it has issues and bugs while upgrading on both android and iOS.
        <br>
        The main issues was the game had already implemented Unity Ads SDK. 
        While removing the Unity Ads, it also bugs some functions of the game such as getting hints and watching interstitial ads.
        <br>
        The most challenging bug that came out because of newly SDK (LionSDK) was in xCode before publishing to AppStore, which has many integrated Ads services. 
        Solving this bug wasn't easy, but I was able to solve it by testing out many steps of xCode issues similar to FirebaseSDK.
        <br>
        In the end, I ended up upgrading SDK in two games, the another one is <a href= "https://www.gamepix.com/play/jump-ball-game" target="_blank">Jumper! (similar game ref)</a>. 
        In this game, I was assigned to upgrade not only SDK, but also game's ball skins and tapping combo.
