        This prototype video is a turn-based hyper-casual F2P game. I was given 2 weeks deadline to make one of the prototype ideas of the client.
        So, within 10 days, I had to develop and finish one, and export the recorded gameplay video to the client.
        <br>
        And I successfully made and finished all of the assigned prototypes.
        The next prototype was a successful one that I made for the client.
