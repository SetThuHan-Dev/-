        This prototype video is one of the prototype ideas of the client. For every prototypes, I was given 10 days, 2 weeks deadline, to export recorded videos which contain win and lose conditions of the gameplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        And I successfully made and finished all of the assigned prototypes in a given time, and had lot of fun since I had to think and code fast for the gameplay scripted by the client.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next prototype was a successful one that I made for the client.
