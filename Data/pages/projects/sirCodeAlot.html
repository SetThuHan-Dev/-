        A game made under a theme, which is held for 2 days by local game jam organization.
        <br>
        "SirCodeAlot" is a theme given by jam organization
        and it has a rule that you have to make a game under its title and must include its provided 2D robot sprite in your game.
        <br>
        In the game, you have to restore the buggy system, which is consumed by bugs, into normal state. 
        You are a 2D robot character, which cannot use any advance framework or tool. So you must get into latest 3D form and 
        unleash the power of framwork by spinning and kill the bugs. And also, your spinning is limited. 
        So, don't forget to boost your form before debugging!
