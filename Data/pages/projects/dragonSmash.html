        This game promote video was my first rendering game scene in Unity using Unity Timelines and Sequences.
        <br>
        And also, this was my initial proposal to the client. I was given 2 weeks deadline.
        So within 10 days, I have to polish and use full potential of the Unity Engine's HDRP to get a bit of realistic, this is what the client wants.
        <br>
        There were many challenging parts like camera angle, effects, character pose, and environments.
        Well, I gained the client's trust based on the environment which I deeply polished details using thousands of grass on Unity's terrain to get good looking.
        <br>
        The most time consumming parts were getting the camera shots to the main character and doing animation retargeting between the main character and the sword in Unity timeline. Of course, I had to rely on and use the characters' animations from Unity's Paid Assets.
        If the animations were OK or confirmed by the client, then I had no option and had to use those animations. But in reality, the paid assets' animations were not detailed since the client checked frame per frame. 
        That's why to solve this issue, animation retargettings were come in.
        <br>
        Based on the client's trust, the quality does matter even in a given short time.
        That's why I was assigned to control qualities of other juniors' final videos.
        <br>
        I really did multi-task while controlling mine, and also guided how to achieve the effects and camera angles what the client wants.
        <br>
        Below is the final rendered videos in Unity using Unity recorder. Since I did not get full permisson to show in public, but only in porfolio with watermark and Youtube's unlisted link.
