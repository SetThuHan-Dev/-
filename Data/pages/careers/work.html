    <br>
    I developed fully optimized Unity WebGL games communicating back and fort to Web Backend and Flutter, for Android and iOS platforms.
    <br><br>
    As a senior game developer in this company, and took responsibilities of developing any type of games with my favourite Unity game engine from optimal game concepts and designs to final release, suitable for WebGL running on App's mobile web browsers, provided by Flutter's InAppWebView package.
    This involved a bit of Dart, HTML, JS and Web API integrations to communicate with Flutter. For Multiplayer game, I used Socket.IO in NodeJS for Server-Side programming and Unity WebGL for Client-Side.

    <div class="edu-title-medium">Unity Game Developer</div>
    I was given the position of developing Casual and Hyper Casual games for in-house and clients targeted mobile platforms (Android, iOS) and collaborated with japanese senior game developers, and AppLovin publisher with their AppLovin SDK for in-game Ads and publishing games.
    <br><br> 
    I joined as a junior game developer just after leaving from Coca-Cola company. My first project was a game prototype from japanese client, also known as MagicAnt Studio in Japan. 
    <br><br>
    I was assigned to upgrade Lion SDK and fix bugs in their trended puzzle game called "Route".
    It was really a challenging thing for me since there was only 4 or 5 pages of SDK documentation and no solution can be found for fixing SDK bugs for both android and iOS.
    <br><br>
    I was also given the position of quality control and assurancing in clients' games handled by junior game developers.
    <br><br>
    I involved in rendering realistic game promote videos using Unity HDRP's full potentials, and was assigned to guide other junior game developers in creating effects and visual scenarios what the clients want.
    <br>
    In details, the full-HD video rendering time, just for 30 seconds, in Unity engine was around an hour based on post-processing, high textured realistic 3D models, amount of characters (eg: thousands of goblins in realtime game view with realtime lighting), visual effects by both VFX and Shader graphs.
    Sometimes, even Unity engine cannot handle due to GPU overhead and often happened crashing during rendering progress. For fast pace of creating videos, I used full potentials of engine by combining scriptings, animation retargeting, timelines and sequences.
    <br><br>
    And I also collaborated in Sanrio's 10 mini-game 2D project with 4 or 5 game developers. In this case, I was assigned implementing bingo system, fixing bugs and adding new features as senior.
    <br><br>
    As the final project, I was given a story-driven project based on anime, which is one of my favourite animes, called JOJO Stone Ocean. The project was included 3 mini-game with story-driven cut scenes.
